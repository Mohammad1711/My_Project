# Car Advertisement Data Analysis

## Description
Welcome to the Car Advertisement Data Analysis project! This project is focused on analyzing a dataset of car advertisements to uncover insights related to car prices, conditions, and other features. The project includes a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to interact with the data through visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots. By providing these insights, the application helps users make informed decisions when buying or selling cars.

The project is implemented in Python using Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly Express for creating interactive visualizations.

 # Features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Perform basic exploratory data analysis on the car advertisement dataset.
* Visualize data distributions using histograms.
* Explore relationships between different variables with scatter plots.
--* Web Application:
* A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
* Interactive visualizations that allow filtering of data based on user preferences.
  
 * Getting Started
* Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Pip (Python package installer)

# Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the creators of the Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit libraries for making this project possible.
Thanks to the reviewers for their valuable feedback that helped improve this project.
# Additional Notes:
Exploratory Data Analysis (Notebook):
Structure: Ensure your notebook has a clear structure with sections for loading data, basic exploration, data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values), and visualization.
Comments: Add comments throughout your code to explain the reasoning behind your decisions, especially in the data cleaning and transformation steps.
Visualization: Include a few key visualizations using Plotly Express, and interpret what these visualizations reveal about the data.
